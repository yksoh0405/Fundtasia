                <p>
                    Your donation creates hope and opportunity within our community by empowering us to minister to people’s physical, social and spiritual needs.
                    When a child is born into an impoverished family, they enter the first phase of a long and challenging cycle that can run for generations. When a
                    family lives in poverty, they usually have very limited or no access to resources. But you are able to change that by contributing!
